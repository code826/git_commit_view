ok for this project i choose node js as backend as we don't need any DB and all i prefer to use Node js because of handy
also it doesn't require very heavy calcuation
 do first i develop the backend in the backend i first udnerstanf the rest api of git and see what field i need to use 
 to get the data provided in the two backend api you given
 on lookign into it i got to know it can come from single rest api 
 https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/commits/${oid}
  so in the backend i created 3 api 
  one for /all which give me both details basicDetails like author , commiter, change time and all and second one is diff details 
  that give me hunks line changed and all

  also as asked in documentation i have open two endpoint 
  http://localhost:5000/repositories/{owner}/{repository}/commits/{oid}
  for getting commitsInfo
  --IMAGE--

  http://localhost:5000/repositories/{owner}/{repository}/commits/{oid}/diff
  for gettign commits diff

  ok so once i able to get it 
  the most challenging part of it was to get the accurate regular expression to filter out line udnerstand the status and baseLine and headLine

  so once it is done , i moved to frontend

  frontend have not so many pages but there is repition like each file diff has same UI so i used react it is easy to setup and use and 2nd json data transfer 

  so in frontend i created 4 compoentn
  App --> to handle route ( like if url is incorrect redirect it to info Page where i have mention what tolook for )
  CommitPage --> to make api call 

  Setup 
  after unzipping the file your system should have node js try use node js of version 21.5.0 to avoid any packages issues

after unzipping it just go and run npm run setup
it will itself start it by default backend will use PORT = 80001 if any process is running on it just change the 
backend/.env --> PORT and re run it 

 once script will start you can see it running

Improvement 
 i believe there are few scope of Improvement
 first is UI , we can make it compatible with every screen and make it looks more good 
 option to compare with different commit Id
 search option to get the repo name once someone enter the username

 suggestion of high rated reposiroty on bu default we can do so
